       "#Instruction#: Pria bought a new car that advertised an estimated gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon with regular gasoline. The car has a 12-gallon tank. She wants to test the car's fuel efficiency under varying conditions and different fuel types. To do this, she fills her tank with 4 gallons of regular gasoline, 4 gallons of premium gasoline, and 4 gallons of diesel. While using regular gasoline, she drove in the city, making frequent stops and her car had a mileage of 30 miles per gallon. With premium gasoline, the car was driven on highways at a constant speed, resulting in a mileage of 40 miles per gallon. While using diesel, she experienced heavy traffic causing her car to have a mileage of 32 miles per gallon.\n",

       "#Instruction#: Pria bought a new car that advertised an estimated gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon with regular gasoline. The car has a 12-gallon tank. She wants to test the car's fuel efficiency under varying conditions and different fuel types. To do this, she fills her tank with 4 gallons of regular gasoline, 4 gallons of premium gasoline, and 4 gallons of diesel. While using regular gasoline, she drove in the city, making frequent stops and her car had a mileage of 30 miles per gallon. With premium gasoline, the car was driven on highways at a constant speed, resulting in a mileage of 40 miles per gallon. While using diesel, she experienced heavy traffic causing her car to have a mileage of 32 miles per gallon. Calculate the weighted average miles per gallon for Pria's car based on her driving experience and the different fuel types used, considering a 5% decrease in fuel efficiency when the temperature drops below freezing. Additionally, determine the percentage of total miles driven under each condition and calculate the cost per mile for each fuel type, assuming the price of regular gasoline is $3.00 per gallon, premium gasoline is $3.50 per gallon, and diesel is $3.20 per gallon. What is the difference, in miles per gallon, between Pria's weighted average mileage and the advertised mileage?\n",
